                This is a first attempt at building a wine review app using Reactjs.
                <p/>
                I made this app because I love wine and I wanted a way to easily record my thoughts and impressions about the wines I have tried.
                It is tough for me to remember specific details about a wine even a day or so after drinking it, so this helps me to compare notes about wines I have enjoyed in the past.
                This also helps me to make better purchasing decisions in the future as I am able to see what I have enjoyed and find my favorite wine within a certain price range.
                I hope this app helps you to enjoy your wine more and that you will find new favorites in the near future!
                <p/>
                Currently, you can review wines and save your scores and comments. You can also view any past reviews in the "results" section.
                <p/>
                New features, updates, and fixes will be coming soon.
